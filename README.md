# 🚧 MotStar Replica (Under Development)

### 🌟 A Passion Project to Showcase Talent – Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Hey there! This is a **MotStar-inspired replica** that I'm currently building using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's a work in progress, and I’m doing my best to make it smooth, stylish, and functional – just like the real thing!

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Recreate the look and feel of the original MotStar platform
- Improve my frontend skills (especially in animations and layouts)
